# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System with Rollups and Aggregates

## Overview
This application is designed to monitor weather conditions in real-time using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides features such as temperature rollups, weather condition summaries, and user-configurable alert thresholds. The system supports real-time data collection for multiple cities and allows users to view historical data and forecasts.

## Key Features:

-Real-time weather data monitoring: Continuously retrieve data from OpenWeatherMap at user-configured intervals.

-Rollups and aggregates: Calculate daily weather summaries including average, max, min temperatures, and dominant weather conditions.

-Alerting system: User-defined thresholds trigger alerts when conditions are met (e.g., temperature exceeding 35Â°C).

-Forecast integration: Retrieve weather forecasts for future conditions and generate summaries.

-Visualization: Provide graphs and charts for daily summaries, trends, and alerts (using libraries such as Matplotlib).

## Design Choices

### Architecture

- ***Flask Framework***: This Python micro-framework is used to handle API routes, user requests, and scheduling of weather data retrieval.
  
-***APSchedule***r: The task scheduling library handles periodic weather data retrieval and threshold checking.

-***PostgreSQL***: Weather data and daily summaries are stored in a PostgreSQL database for persistence.

-***OpenWeatherMap API***: External weather data is fetched using this API. Both real-time and forecast data are integrated into the system.

-***Visualization***: Weather data trends and summaries are visualized using Matplotlib for interactive and static graph generation.

## Data Model

-***Weather Data***: Stores raw weather data retrieved from the API.

-***Daily Summary***: Aggregates data including min, max, average temperatures, and dominant weather condition for each city.

-***Alerts***: Stores and tracks user-defined alert conditions and thresholds for each city.

## Error Handling

-***API Key Errors***: Handles invalid or expired API keys by logging errors and notifying the user.

-***Threshold Handling***: Validates threshold values and types before storing them in the system to avoid runtime errors.

## Build Instructions

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.Python 3.x (preferably Python 3.9 or higher)
2.PostgreSQL 13+
3.OpenWeatherMap API Key (sign up at OpenWeatherMap)

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Clone the repository
   
git clone https://github.com/muskansinghal26/weather_monitor.git
cd weather_monitor

2. Set up a virtual environment
   
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

3. Install dependencies
   
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dependencies include:**

-Flask
-APScheduler
-Requests
-Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL adapter)
-Matplotlib (for visualization)

4. Set up PostgreSQL database
1.Ensure PostgreSQL is running.

2.Create a new database:
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE weather_monitor;

3.Update the database credentials in config.py:
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/weather_monitor'

4. Configure environment variables
You need to set up environment variables for:

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: Your OpenWeatherMap API Key.
***Example (Linux/MacOS):***

export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY='your_api_key'

***Example (Windows Command Prompt):***

set OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key

6. Initialize the database
To create the required tables, run the following:

python init_db.py

7. Run the application
Start the Flask development server:

python app.py
The application should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

8. Testing
To run tests:

python -m unittest discover

## API Endpoints
1. **POST /set_threshold**

- Allows users to set alert thresholds for temperature and other weather conditions.
- Example body:
  {
  "threshold_type": "temperature",
  "city": "Mumbai",
  "threshold_value": 35,
  "duration": 2
}

2. **GET /get_summary**

Retrieves the daily weather summary for all cities.

3.**GET /get_forecast**

Fetches and displays forecast data.

## Running with Docker

To containerize the application, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
   
docker build -t weather_monitor .

2. Run the container:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key weather_monitor

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Refused on localhost:** Ensure the Flask server is running and accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
  
-**API Key Error:** Ensure that the OpenWeatherMap API key is set up as an environment variable and valid.
  
-**Database Connection Issues:** Check PostgreSQL service status and ensure credentials in config.py are correct.

## Future Improvements

-Add support for additional weather parameters like wind speed, humidity, and air pressure in rollups and aggregates.

-Enhance the alerting system to send notifications via email/SMS.

-Add forecast-based alerting to predict future threshold breaches.
